## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will read and solve addition word problems and write matching number sentences with symbols (+ and =) for sums up to 10.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can read and understand an addition story.  
- I can use a drawing or objects to solve it.  
- I can write a number sentence that shows what happened in the story.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Math Story Theater”**  
Act out a quick scenario:  
> “3 students are sitting. 4 more walk in. How many now?”  
Have students model with fingers or counters and try to say the matching number sentence.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Story Problem Stations**  
   Rotate through stations with printed word problems. Students:  
   - Read or listen to the story  
   - Use cubes to model  
   - Draw the model  
   - Write a number sentence

2. **Equation Match**  
   Given a drawing or scenario, students pick from a set of 3 equations and circle the correct one.

3. **Partner Problem Swap**  
   Each student creates a story, draws it, and gives it to a partner to solve and write the number sentence.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Use simple stories with visuals and manipulatives. Pre-write number banks.

- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Use unknowns in different positions (e.g., “___ + 4 = 8”). Introduce vertical equations.

- **ELL/ML**:  
  Add picture cues and sentence frames:  
  > “There were ___, then ___ came. Now there are ___.”

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
Walk around during stations. Check if students’ models match their number sentences.  
Ask:  
> “How does your drawing show your story?”

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Word problem cards or slides  
- Cubes or counters  
- Recording sheets with drawing and equation boxes  
- Crayons/pencils  
- Pre-written number sentence cards (for matching)

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Students write one word problem of their own, draw it, and write the number sentence. Volunteers share with the class.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Write an addition story using family or pets at home.  
- **Math Journal**: Reflect: “How can I show math with words and numbers?”
