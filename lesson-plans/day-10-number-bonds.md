# 📘 Grade 1 Math • Day 10 Lesson Plan  
**Topic:** Using Number Bonds to Strengthen Addition & Subtraction Thinking  
**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Week:** 2 — Quarter 1

---

## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.OA.C.5**  
Relate counting to addition and subtraction (e.g., count on 2 to add 2).  

**WI.MATH.1.OA.B.4**  
Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will use number bonds to show relationships between numbers and explain how parts and wholes can be used for both addition and subtraction.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can show two parts that make a whole using number bonds.  
- I can write an addition and a subtraction fact using the same numbers.  
- I can explain how the parts and whole are related.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Who’s Missing?” Game**  
Show a number bond with the whole and one part. Ask:  
> “Who’s missing from this number family?”  
Let students guess and prove it with counters.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Number Bond Builders**  
   Students use counters to model two parts and a whole on number bond templates. Then write the addition sentence and related subtraction sentence.

2. **Fact Family Match-Up**  
   Give students cards with 3 related numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5). They build and record both addition and subtraction facts.

3. **Number Bond Scoot Game**  
   Place number bonds around the room with a missing number. Students rotate to solve and record their work.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Use visual number bond mats and manipulatives for small totals (up to 10).

- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Extend to totals up to 20; challenge to write 4 related facts per number bond.

- **ELL/ML**:  
  Provide sentence frames:  
  > “___ and ___ make ___. ___ minus ___ is ___.”  
  Include visual labels for part/part/whole.

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
Use a checklist as students build number bonds and record equations.  
Listen for explanations of how parts relate to the whole.

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Number bond templates  
- Counters or linking cubes  
- Pre-made fact family cards  
- Scoot game setup (laminated number bonds, clipboards)  
- Dry-erase markers or pencils

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Each student builds a number bond and writes 2 addition + 2 subtraction facts. Share with a partner and explain how they’re connected.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Connection**: Find toys or snack groups and build number bonds at home.  
- **Digital Center**: Assign a number bond game from SplashLearn or Toy Theater.
