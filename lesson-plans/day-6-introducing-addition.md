## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.OA.A.1**  
Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, putting together, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions using objects, drawings, and equations.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will model addition using real objects and drawings and write addition equations for totals up to 10.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can combine two groups of objects to find the total.  
- I can draw pictures to represent an addition story.  
- I can write an equation that matches my drawing.

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Stuffed Animal Story”**  
Show 3 stuffed animals on one side of a mat and 2 on the other.  
Ask:  
> “How many animals altogether?”  
Draw it out together, then write 3 + 2 = 5.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Hands-On Addition with Counters**  
   Students use 2-color counters to model different addition facts (e.g., 4 red + 3 yellow). Then write the matching equation.

2. **Draw & Solve Story Problems**  
   Read simple story problems aloud (e.g., “There are 5 birds. 2 more join them.”). Students draw and label the solution, then write an equation.

3. **“Addition Match” Card Game**  
   Students match picture cards (dot or object drawings) to number sentences (e.g., card with 🍎🍎🍎 + 🍎🍎 → 5).

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Use small numbers (1–5), provide number lines, act out problems physically.

- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Challenge with totals up to 15; introduce missing addends.

- **ELL/ML**:  
  Use visuals, sentence frames: “___ and ___ is ___.” Model language using realia.

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
Observe student models and equations during activities.  
Ask students to explain:  
> “What do your counters show?”  
> “How do your pictures match your equation?”

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- 2-color counters  
- Object picture cards (for game)  
- Drawing paper and pencils  
- Whiteboards and markers  
- Optional: stuffed animals or small toys for demo

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Turn and talk: “What was your favorite addition story today?”  
Students draw one problem on a mini whiteboard and share their equation.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Use toys or snacks at home to make their own addition story.  
- **Digital Game**: Assign addition puzzles via ABCya or Starfall.
