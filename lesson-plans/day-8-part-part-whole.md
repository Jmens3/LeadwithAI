# 📘 Grade 1 Math • Day 8 Lesson Plan  
**Topic:** Exploring the Part-Part-Whole Relationship  
**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Week:** 2 — Quarter 1

---

## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.OA.B.4**  
Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem.  
> Example: Subtract 10 – 8 by finding the number that makes 10 when added to 8.

📝 *This lesson introduces the part-part-whole model to lay the foundation for addition and subtraction connections.*

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will understand how two numbers can be parts of a whole and use part-part-whole diagrams to solve addition problems and discover missing parts.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can identify the whole and parts in a number sentence.  
- I can show parts that make a whole using cubes or drawings.  
- I can find a missing part when given one part and the whole.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Mystery Box” Challenge**  
Place 5 cubes in a covered container and pull out 2. Ask:  
> “How many are still hiding?”  
Repeat with different combinations.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Part-Part-Whole Mat Practice**  
   Students use mats with three circles. They place cubes in two “part” circles and count the total in the “whole” circle.

2. **Find the Missing Part Game**  
   Provide a total (whole) and one part. Students use manipulatives or draw to figure out the missing part.

3. **Draw & Record**  
   Students draw their own part-part-whole models and write a related equation (e.g., 2 + ___ = 5).

---

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Start with totals under 10; model with real objects; allow partner support.

- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Use 3-number combinations (e.g., 2 + 3 + ___ = 10); extend to totals up to 20.

- **ELL/ML**:  
  Use visuals and number vocabulary; reinforce sentence frames:  
  > “The parts are ___ and ___. The whole is ___.”

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
Observe mat work and listen to student explanations.  
Ask:  
> “How do you know that’s the missing part?”  
Collect exit slips with one part-part-whole drawing and equation.

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Part-part-whole mats  
- Cubes or counters  
- Dry-erase markers  
- Drawing paper or exit slip templates  
- Optional: small containers or boxes for Mystery Box game

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Students solve a part-part-whole challenge on a mini whiteboard:  
> “The whole is 8. One part is 3. What’s the missing part?”  
Then turn and talk to explain their strategy.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Find two groups of toys or objects and write an addition sentence.  
- **Center Activity**: Use digital tools (e.g., Toy Theater’s part-part-whole game).
