## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.OA.B.4**  
Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem.  
> Example: 7 = ___ + 3 — students solve for the unknown using drawings or objects.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will solve for missing parts in addition number sentences using drawings, counters, and reasoning strategies.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can use tools and drawings to solve for a missing number.  
- I can explain how I found the missing part.  
- I can check my work using addition or subtraction.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“The Missing Math Detective”**  
Write: `___ + 4 = 7` on the board. Ask:  
> “What could the missing number be?”  
Have students guess and prove it using cubes or fingers.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Build & Solve Task Cards**  
   Give students task cards with number sentences missing an addend (e.g., `___ + 3 = 6`).  
   Students use counters to build both known and unknown parts.

2. **Draw & Fill the Blank**  
   Students draw dots or pictures for the known part, then draw more until they reach the total. Record the full equation.

3. **Partner Check Challenge**  
   One student picks a number sentence with a missing addend and solves. The partner checks the answer with addition and subtraction.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Use total sums ≤ 10; model with manipulatives side-by-side.

- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Introduce problems with unknowns in different positions:  
  `6 = ___ + 2` and `___ = 4 + 3`

- **ELL/ML**:  
  Use sentence starters:  
  > “I added ___ and ___ to make ___.”  
  Use visual math word banks with symbols and vocabulary.

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
Students complete 3 missing addend problems independently using drawings or objects.  
Checklist:  
✔️ Strategy shown  
✔️ Equation complete  
✔️ Answer correct  
✔️ Oral or written explanation given

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Task cards (with missing addends)  
- Counters or connecting cubes  
- Mini whiteboards and markers  
- Drawing paper or printed templates  
- Pencils

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
**"Prove It!"**  
Show `__ + 5 = 9`. Ask for two different ways to solve. Students explain their thinking to the group.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Ask a parent to give them “mystery total” problems to solve at home.  
- **Digital Practice**: Use “Math Playground” or “SplashLearn” missing addend games.
