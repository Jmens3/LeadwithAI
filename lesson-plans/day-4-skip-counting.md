# 📘 Grade 1 Math • Day 4 Lesson Plan  
**Topic:** Skip Counting by 2s, 5s, and 10s  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  

---

## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.NBT.A.1**  
Count to 120, starting at any number less than 120. In this range, read and write numerals and represent a number of objects with a written numeral.

> ✅ **Extension**: Skip counting prepares students for grouping, patterns, and multiplication in Grade 2.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will fluently skip count by 2s, 5s, and 10s up to 120 using patterns and real-world objects.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can skip count by 2s, 5s, and 10s accurately.  
- I can explain the patterns I notice when skip counting.

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**"Skip Count & Clap" Game**  
The class skip counts aloud by 10s while clapping. Repeat with 2s and 5s. Ask:  
> “What do you notice about the numbers?”

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Skip Counting Number Line Walk**  
   Number cards placed around the classroom floor in order. Students hop or step from number to number while skip counting aloud by 2s, 5s, or 10s.

2. **Pattern Hunt on a Hundreds Chart**  
   Students use different colors to highlight skip-count sequences (e.g., circle all multiples of 5 in blue). Discuss patterns that appear in the columns or rows.

3. **Counting Chains**  
   Using string and beads or buttons, students group in 2s, 5s, or 10s and record the total count of beads they built.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Count to smaller ranges (e.g., to 30 or 50); use charts and chant together.  
- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Start skip counting from non-zero values (e.g., “Start at 3 and count by 2s”) or skip count backward.  
- **ELL/ML**:  
  Add gesture support and sentence frames: “I skip count by ___s. I said ___, ___, ___…”

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
- Monitor how students move through the number line walk.  
- Ask:  
  > “What do all the numbers you highlighted have in common?”

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Floor number cards (1–120)  
- Hundreds charts  
- Crayons/highlighters  
- Beads or buttons  
- String or pipe cleaners  
- Pencils and recording sheets

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
In pairs, students pick a skip-counting rule (2s, 5s, or 10s), choose a starting number, and orally practice together.  
Then share:  
> “What pattern did you see?”

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Count things at home (e.g., “I have 10 fingers. Let’s count by 5s!”).  
- **Digital Center**: Assign skip-counting games via ABCya, Toy Theater, or SplashLearn.
