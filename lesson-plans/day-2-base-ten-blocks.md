# 📘 Grade 1 Math • Day 2 Lesson Plan  
**Topic**: Building Number Sense with Base Ten Blocks  
**Date**: September 2, 2025  

---

## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.NBT.A.2**  
Understand that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones.  
- 10 can be thought of as a bundle of ten ones — called a “ten”  
- Numbers 11–19 are composed of a ten and one, two, three, etc.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will understand that two-digit numbers represent tens and ones using base ten blocks. Students will compose and decompose numbers 11–19 using visual models.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**Number Detective Challenge!**  
Show the number 14 on the board. Ask:  
> “Can anyone guess how many tens and ones are hiding in this number?”  
Reveal 1 ten and 4 ones using base ten blocks.

---

## 🧠 Activities (Student-Centered)  
1. **Base Ten Block Matching Game**  
   Students match numeral cards (11–19) with a picture card showing tens and ones blocks.

2. **Build & Draw**  
   Using actual base ten blocks, students build numbers and draw the tens and ones on a recording sheet.

3. **Partner Decompose**  
   In pairs, students pick a number card, break it into tens and ones, and explain to their partner.

---

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies  
- **Struggling Learners**: Use numbers 11–15 only; provide pre-drawn visuals.  
- **Advanced Learners**: Extend numbers up to 99; ask for two different ways to build the same number.  
- **Multilingual Learners**: Use sentence frames: “14 has 1 ten and 4 ones.” Provide language visuals.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can show how many tens and ones are in a number.  
- I can use base ten blocks to model two-digit numbers.

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
- Observe students during Build & Draw for correct tens and ones representation.  
- Collect completed partner decomposition sheets for review.

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Base ten blocks (at least 2 tens, 10+ ones per student)  
- Number cards (11–19)  
- Recording sheets  
- Crayons or markers

---

## 🧵 Closure Activity  
Circle discussion:  
> “What number did you build today? How many tens and ones did it have?”  
Record student responses on the board.

---

## 🧠 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Connection**: Ask students to find objects at home that could represent “tens” and “ones.”  
- **Digital Base Ten Tool**: Use an online base ten simulation to reinforce learning.
