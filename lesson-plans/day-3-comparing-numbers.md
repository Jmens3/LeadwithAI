## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.NBT.B.3**  
Compare two two-digit numbers based on meanings of the tens and ones digits, recording the results of comparisons with the symbols `>`, `<`, and `=`.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will compare two-digit numbers using place value understanding and correctly use the symbols `>`, `<`, and `=` to record comparisons.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can compare two-digit numbers by looking at the tens and ones.  
- I can use `>`, `<`, or `=` correctly to compare numbers.

---

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Number Showdown!”**  
Show two number cards (e.g., 42 vs. 37). Ask:  
> “Which one wins? Why?”  
Students vote by thumbs up/down/sideways, followed by a brief discussion.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Place Value Chart Race**  
   - Students roll two dice to create two-digit numbers (e.g., roll 6 and 3 = 63).  
   - Fill in a place value chart (tens and ones), then compare with a partner’s number using a symbol.

2. **Compare & Color Worksheet**  
   - Worksheet shows number pairs. Students circle or color the greater number and write the correct comparison symbol.

3. **Math Talk Circle**  
   - Group discussion: “How did you know 64 was greater than 46?”  
   - Encourage use of math language: tens, ones, greater, equal, less.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Use base-ten blocks and comparison cards side-by-side; focus on one digit at a time (tens first).  
- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Compare 3+ numbers and order them from least to greatest.  
- **ELL/ML**:  
  Provide visual cues (e.g., posters with `>`, `<`, `=`), and sentence stems like:  
  > “__ is greater than __ because…”

## 📝 Formative Assessment

- Use whiteboards for fast checks: Teacher says two numbers → students write symbol.  
- Collect worksheets to assess comparison accuracy and explanation logic.

---

## 📦 Materials Needed

- Dice (2 per student pair)  
- Place value charts  
- Number cards (optional)  
- “Compare & Color” worksheet  
- Base-ten blocks or counters  
- Whiteboards and markers

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity

**Quick Draw**  
Each student picks two numbers, draws a comparison symbol between them, and explains their choice to a partner.

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas

- **Home Challenge**: Compare numbers around the house — “Which is more: forks or spoons?”  
- **Digital Practice**: Use tools like SplashLearn or Toy Theater to practice comparing numbers online.
