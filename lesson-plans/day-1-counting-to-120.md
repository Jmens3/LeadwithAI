## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will be able to count fluently to 120, read and write numerals up to 120, and represent quantities with numerals when given a set of objects.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can count to 120 starting from any number  
- I can write numbers correctly  
- I can match a group of objects to a number

---

## 🌟 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
“Let’s take a Counting Walk.” Students walk around the classroom, counting real objects (e.g., windows, pencils, books) aloud with the teacher.

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)  

1. **Choral Counting (1–120):** Count aloud with class using a large number chart.  
2. **Number Writing Station:** Students write teacher-shown numbers (1–120) on whiteboards.  
3. **Object Match:** Count 10–20 physical objects (counters, cubes) and write corresponding numerals.

---

## 🎯 Differentiation Strategies  
- **Struggling Learners:** Focus on 1–50 or count by tens  
- **Advanced Learners:** Start at higher numbers (e.g., 75); skip count by tens  
- **ELLs:** Use number cards with visuals and word support (“30 – thirty”)

---

## ✍️ Formative Assessment  
- Observe oral counting for fluency  
- Review whiteboard numeral accuracy  
- Check object-to-number matching accuracy

---

## 🧰 Materials Needed  
- 120 chart  
- Whiteboards & markers  
- 20 counters/cubes per student  
- Paper and pencils

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Students share their favorite number from today and explain why they like it. Optional: post number on class chart.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge:** Count 10–15 items and record how many  
- **Poster Creation:** Create a colorful number poster (1–50) with drawings or stickers
