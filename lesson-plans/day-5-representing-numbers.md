**Date:** September 5, 2025  

---

## 🧩 Wisconsin State Standard(s)  
**WI.MATH.1.NBT.A.1**  
Count to 120, starting at any number less than 120. In this range, read and write numerals and represent a number of objects with a written numeral.  
> ✅ **Focus Extension**: Students use multiple models (tally marks, pictures, number words) to represent the same quantity.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  
Students will represent numbers up to 20 using tally marks, pictorial models (stick drawings or dots), and numerals.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- I can use tally marks to show a number.  
- I can draw pictures or symbols to represent a number.  
- I can explain what my drawing or tallies show.

## 🎬 Hook (Engaging Intro)  
**“Tally Detective!”**  
Display a quick classroom poll (e.g., “What’s your favorite fruit?”). Use tally marks to record responses on the board. Ask:  
> “How can we count these fast?”

---

## 🎲 Activities (Student-Centered)

1. **Tally & Draw Centers**  
   Rotate students through stations where they:  
   - Count real objects (e.g., cubes, paperclips) and make tally charts  
   - Draw matching quantities using stick figures or dots  
   - Write numerals to match each model

2. **Tally Sort Game**  
   Students match tally marks, pictures, and numerals (pre-made cards) as fast as they can.

3. **Create a Class Chart**  
   Collect data on a class question (e.g., “How many siblings?”), record tallies, and add picture representations.

## 🧩 Differentiation Strategies

- **Struggling Learners**:  
  Work with small numbers (under 10), use real objects to guide representations.  
- **Advanced Learners**:  
  Create multi-step problems: “Show 15 using 2 models, then explain how you could add 2 more.”  
- **ELL/ML**:  
  Use labeled visuals and gestures. Introduce terms like “tally,” “group of five,” “symbol” with pictures.

---

## 📝 Formative Assessment  
- Use a quick check worksheet with images and tallies to match.  
- Ask:  
  > “What number do your tallies show? How do you know?”

---

## 📦 Materials Needed  
- Real objects (buttons, blocks, etc.)  
- Tally cards, picture cards, number cards  
- Blank paper, clipboards, or recording sheets  
- Crayons or pencils

---

## 🧠 Closure Activity  
Each student creates a mini poster showing a number of their choice in 3 ways:  
- Tally marks  
- Pictures  
- Numeral

They present it in small groups or do a gallery walk.

---

## 💡 Optional Extension Ideas  
- **Home Challenge**: Track how many times they blink, jump, or hear a bell — record with tallies.  
- **Math Station**: Add this activity into a regular data collection center.
