# 📣 Join the Movement: How MPS Employees Can Help Solve Our Staffing Challenge

Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) is hiring—and we need your help to reach more high-quality, certified educators who are passionate about serving students.

## 💼 Why This Matters

Across Wisconsin and the nation, districts are experiencing a historic shortage of licensed teachers. MPS is no exception. But what if each of us helped fill that gap by referring just one strong candidate?

That’s the goal. One referral. One educator. One classroom changed.
