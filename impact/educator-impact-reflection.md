AI Prompting for Educators A 7-Day Beginner’s Guide to ChatGPT in the Classroom

Save Time, Spark Creativity, and Teach Smarter with AI

Joshua E. Mensah Education Leadership & AI Advocate, MPS

Day 1: What is AI Prompting & Why Educators Need It

Welcome to Day 1 of your 7-day guide to AI prompting in the classroom! Today, we lay the foundation: what prompting is, why it matters, and how it can revolutionize your teaching practice.

🤖 What is AI Prompting?

AI prompting is the art of crafting clear, specific inputs—called prompts—that guide artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT to generate meaningful, creative, or instructional responses. A prompt might be a:

Question

Instruction

Scenario

Role-based task

Example Prompts:

"Summarize this article for 5th grade science students."

"Create a list of debate topics appropriate for 9th grade social studies."

🎯 Why It Matters for Educators

AI Prompting empowers teachers to:

✅ Save Time: Automate lesson planning, emails, rubrics, and more.

💡 Enhance Creativity: Brainstorm prompts, activities, and alternative approaches.

📈 Boost Student Engagement: Customize responses to be age-appropriate, relatable, and exciting.

🧠 Expand Teaching Strategies: Generate scaffolds, tiered questions, and enrichment paths.

📚 Real Classroom Story: Ms. Rivera's Time Saver

Ms. Rivera, a 6th grade teacher in Milwaukee, used ChatGPT to draft her weekly parent email. What once took her 45 minutes, now takes less than 10. "I just tell ChatGPT to summarize our class goals in family-friendly language, and it nails it."

📝 Your Turn

Take a moment to reflect:

1. What are 2 classroom tasks you’d love to automate using AI?

2. How could AI save you time this week?

Optional Prompt:

"Act as a middle school teacher. Draft a short message to parents about missing assignments that is kind but firm."

Day 2: Setting Up ChatGPT & Exploring the Interface

Today’s goal is to get you set up and comfortable navigating ChatGPT. Whether you're brand-new or somewhat familiar, this walkthrough will give you the confidence to get started.

🛠️ Getting Started with ChatGPT

Go to:

Sign Up: Use your email, Google, or Microsoft account.

Choose a Version:

Free: GPT-3.5 (excellent for most educational tasks)

Paid: GPT-4 ($20/month, better memory and reasoning)

🖥️ Navigating the Interface

Once logged in, you’ll see:

Input Box (bottom): Where you type your prompts

Sidebar/History Panel (left): Review and rename past chats

Reset Thread: Clears the chat for a fresh start

Example Prompt:

"Create a 5-question multiple choice quiz on the water cycle for 6th grade."

Observe the output. What worked? What didn’t? Would you rephrase it?

➡️ Next Step: Day 3 – Crafting Simple Prompts Using the ACT Framework

Day 3: Crafting Simple Prompts Using the ACT Framework

The ACT Framework helps you structure clear, effective prompts:

A: Assign a Role — “Act as a middle school math teacher..."

C: Clarify the Task — “...design a 3-day review lesson on fractions..."

T: Tailor the Output — “...formatted as an outline for 5th graders."

✨ Full Prompt Example:

"Act as a science teacher. Create a 10-minute warm-up on the human body. Format it as a multiple-choice quiz for 8th graders."

📝 Practice:

Fill in the template below:

Act as a ____________. Create ____________. Format as ____________.

➡️ Next Step: Day 4 – Lesson Planning with ChatGPT

Day 4: Lesson Planning with ChatGPT

Use this prompt template:

"Create a 45-minute lesson plan on [topic] for [grade]. Include objectives, materials, steps, and assessment."

🧪 Try This:

"Create a 30-minute inquiry-based lesson on animal habitats for 3rd grade."

"Design a lesson introducing persuasive writing to 6th graders."

🔁 Pro Tip:

Add standards, format requests ("in Google Slides outline"), or learner needs.

➡️ Next Step: Day 5 – Student Feedback & Grading with AI

Day 5: Student Feedback & Grading with AI

Use ChatGPT to assist with:

Writing feedback

Creating rubrics

Drafting report card comments

💬 Example Prompt:

"Act as an English teacher. Provide constructive feedback on this 8th-grade essay: [paste essay]."

📊 Example Rubric Prompt:

"Create a rubric for a science project on ecosystems with scoring bands."

📝 Practice Prompt:

"Give a growth-focused comment for a student who struggled with organization in writing."

➡️ Next Step: Day 6 – Avoiding Common Prompting Mistakes

Day 6: Avoiding Common Prompting Mistakes

🚫 Mistake #1: Being Too Vague

❌ "Make a quiz."

✅ "Create a 5-question multiple-choice quiz on photosynthesis for 7th grade."

🚫 Mistake #2: Overloading

❌ "Write a quiz, rubric, summary, and email."

✅ Break it into steps.

🚫 Mistake #3: Copying Without Editing

✅ Always review and revise before sharing with students.

📝 Fix-It Activity:

Take one of your old prompts and rewrite it using ACT.

➡️ Next Step: Day 7 – Build Your Own Prompt Library

🧭 Bonus: Ethical Use of AI in Education

As educators using cutting-edge technology, it's our responsibility to model ethical, thoughtful practices when working with AI. Here are 5 key principles:

🔐 1. Protect Student Privacy

Never include full student names or sensitive personal data in prompts.

Remove identifying info before pasting student work into ChatGPT.

🧠 2. Use AI as a Support Tool, Not a Replacement

Let AI help with drafts, brainstorming, and scaffolding—but final decisions should come from a professional educator.

🤖 3. Watch for Bias and Inaccuracy

ChatGPT can reflect biases or generate outdated info. Always review for fairness, relevance, and accuracy.

📣 4. Be Transparent with Students

Let students know when AI tools are used and model responsible tech behavior.

🏫 5. Follow School or District Guidelines

Check if your district has AI use policies. When in doubt, ask your admin or tech lead.

Optional Prompt:

"List 5 classroom rules for using AI responsibly, written in kid-friendly language for 6th graders."
