## 🧾 Sample Output

**Classroom AI Use Policy – High School ELA**  

In our class, AI tools like ChatGPT may be used to:

✅ Brainstorm ideas  
✅ Reword unclear sentences  
✅ Get feedback or improve grammar  

You may NOT use AI to:

❌ Write full essays for you  
❌ Copy/paste answers without your own thinking  
❌ Bypass reading or writing tasks  

**What We Expect**:  
- Always let me know if you used AI in your work  
- Your ideas and voice matter — use AI as a helper, not a replacement  
- If you're unsure if it’s okay, ask!

**Teacher Note**:  
If AI is misused, I’ll ask you to revise and reflect on how to use it better next time.

Let’s be honest, respectful, and thoughtful about using AI together.
