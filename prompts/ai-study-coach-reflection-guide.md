## 💬 Example Prompt

> A 9th grade student says: “I study but still forget things on test day. I usually reread notes but get bored. I don’t know what else to do.”

---

## 🧾 Sample Output

**Student Reflection Summary**:  
Student rereads notes but struggles with retention. Feels bored and unsure how to study more effectively.

**Response from AI Study Coach**:  
You're putting in effort — and that matters! Sometimes rereading alone isn't enough to lock information into memory. Try these instead:

- Use flashcards or quiz apps (like Quizlet or Anki)  
- Teach the concept out loud to someone else or even to yourself  
- Break study time into short sessions (25 mins on, 5 mins break)  
- Practice recalling answers without looking at your notes

Also, be kind to yourself. The fact that you're asking for help shows a growth mindset — keep going!
