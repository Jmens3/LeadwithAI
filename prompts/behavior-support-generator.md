Frequent verbal disruptions during independent work in a 6th grade class. Student is highly social and easily excitable.

**Possible Causes**:

**Tier 1 Strategies**:
- Use pre-set visual signals before transitions

- Set class goal: “3-minute quiet build-ups” with rewards

**Tier 2 Supports**:
- Daily check-in with support staff  
- Self-monitoring chart with cues like “voice level”  
- Teach and practice wait-time strategies in advisory

**Teacher Response Tip**:
Redirect calmly using the student’s name and a neutral phrase like, “We’re in work mode now.”
