## 🧾 Sample Output

**What Is AI?**

AI (short for Artificial Intelligence) is a kind of computer system that learns from examples — kind of like how you learn from practice.

Tools like ChatGPT, Siri, or Google Assistant use AI to answer questions, write messages, or even help solve math problems.

**But here’s the thing:**  
AI doesn’t really “think” like a human. It doesn’t have feelings or real understanding. It just uses patterns it’s seen before to give you an answer.

**One Smart Tip**:  
Always double-check what AI tells you, just like you would check facts in a book or with a teacher!
